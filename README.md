<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
We built a real-time, multiplayer version of the tabletop classic - Air Hockey - from the ground-up in Python using Pygame. It utilizes a client-server model where one machine hosts the game server, while multiple clients connect to join and interact in the same game. The game features realistic physics, collision detection, and interactive mechanics that allow players to control paddles, hit a puck, and score goals.


## Game Features:

- Any player can grab any paddle.
  - When a player joins, a new paddle is created and added to the game.
- While a paddle is grabbed by a player, no other player can grab it until itâ€™s released.
- When two paddles collide, both are released.
- Each new paddle added (when a new client joins) cycles between blue, red, pink, and yellow colors.
